Refactoring Excercise 

This is was an excercise in refactoring code, I've listed the changes I made below:

- Changed Title from "Website" to "Horiseon SEO Solutions"

- Changed all <div> tags to a Nav, Main, Aside, footer, section, tag where applicable

- Repaired the link to the Search Engine Optimization section

- Added alt text to all the images 

- Added a Title to the background "Hero" picture, because you can't add Alt Text to CSS images. 

- Removed the float left and float right classes on the images, instead opting to wrap the content section and benefits section in a section and add a class. Then used CSS to apply the float left property to the contents, and float right to the benefits. Lastly I also added some CSS to the online-reputation-management section to make it float right by using an ID and giving it higher specificity than the class it was in.

- Lastly I combined a lot of the redundant CSS
